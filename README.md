# generatePassword

Project was to make a random password generator using the inputs given by the user to determine the password. User got to choose if they wanted lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and/or special characters. When the user presses the button they choose length and features before. Fail safes were also created so if incorrect length was chosen then password couldnt be created and if the user didnt choose any characters then code would stop running.
